# room-app 
A simple web chat application that lets you communicate with other people (obviously). You can create a room, and other can join in it, and all of you can start communicating. I uses the MERN stack to build this application. 

### This application only have three(3) pages: the authentication page, home page, and the chat page.

At the home page, you can either create or join an existing room, simply type the name of the room, and you will be immediately move in the room.
Other buttons and pages are self-explanatory.

## Application Functionality
#### Room Name should be 1 to 16 characters long.
#### If there is no user in a room, the room will be immediately closed, and all messages are deleted.
#### If you join and left a room, the users inside that room will be notified.
